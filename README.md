## SECTION 2 : Overall Introduction
# CD Recommendation System :notes:

Welcome to our CD Recommendation System! In today's vast ocean of digital music, we aim to help you find the melodies that truly resonate with your soul. Dive into our platform and experience a seamless, personalized, and enriched music discovery journey.

## :mag: Search Engine 
Our search engine isn't just a tool—it's your primary gateway into the boundless realm of music. It's designed not just to fetch CD titles, artists, or genres swiftly, but to deeply understand the intent behind each query, ensuring results that are spot on.

## :bust_in_silhouette: User Profile Management 
Your musical preferences evolve, and so does your profile on our platform. This component maintains a dynamic record of your comments, likes, and history. Also, check out the intuitive data visualization on your history page to gain insights into your own musical journey.

## :heart: Recommendation System 
At the heart of our platform, this system doesn't just recommend—it tells a musical story, unique to every user. Here's a peek into its design:
- **Popularity-Based Algorithms**: Shine a spotlight on high-rated and top-selling items.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Dive deeper with techniques like SVD and KNN.
- **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)**: Harnessing the power of deep learning to intricately model user-item relationships.
- **LSTUR Model**: Seamlessly balancing your long-term tastes with new, transient interests. 

Together, these models ensure that every recommendation resonates deeply with your desires, making every listen a delightful discovery.

## :key: User Register/Login 
Your personalized musical odyssey begins here. Once inside, you can traverse through your past reviews, rekindling memories of past favorites, or perhaps taking a second look at previous choices.
